<p>In this assignment, we will use the &#8220;real-time rendering&#8221; shader pipeline and
procedural rendering to create interesting pictures.</p>

<h3 id="glsl">GLSL</h3>

<p>Your work will be implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">OpenGL shading language
(glsl)</a>. In many ways,
glsl code looks like C++ code. However, there are many builtin linear algebra
types (e.g., <code>vec3</code> is a 3D-vector type) and geometric functions (e.g.,
<code>dot(a,b)</code> computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot product</a>
between vectors <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Since vectors are often used to represent spatial
coordinates <em>or</em> colors. We can index the coordinates of a vector (<code>vec3 a</code>)
using <code>a.r</code>, <code>a.g</code>, <code>a.b</code> or <code>a.x</code>, <code>a.y</code>, <code>a.z</code>. When working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection">perspective
projection</a>
it&#8217;s often useful to employ 4D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous
coordinates</a> vectors:
<code>vec4</code> in glsl. Glsl has many builtin ways to work with differently sized
vectors and matrices. For example, if we have <code>vec4 h</code> then we can write <code>vec3 p
= h.xyz;</code> to grab the first three coordinates. Similarly, we could write: <code>vec4
h = vec4(p,1.0)</code> to convert a 3D Cartesian point to a 4D homogeneous point.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many online resources and googling a glsl-related
question often returns helpful answers.</p>

<h3 id="onthecpuside">On the CPU side</h3>

<p>The shaders you write in this assignment will run on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a>. Let&#8217;s breifly
describe what&#8217;s happening on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> side.</p>

<p>A pseudo-code version of <code>main.cpp</code> might look like:</p>

<pre><code>main()
  initialize window
  copy mesh vertex positions V and face indices F to GPU
  while window is open
    if shaders have not been compiled or files have changed 
      compile shaders and send to GPU
    send &quot;uniform&quot; data to GPU
    set all pixels to background color
    tell GPU to draw mesh
    sleep a few milliseconds
</code></pre>

<h4 id="window">Window</h4>

<p>Creating a window is clearly something that will depend on the operating system
(e.g., Mac OS X, Linux, Windows). This assignment, like many small scale
graphics programs or games, uses an open source windowing toolkit called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLFW">glfw</a>. It works on all major operating
systems. Once the window is open we have access to its contents as an RGB image.
The job of our programs are to fill in all the pixels of this image with colors.
The windowing toolkit also handles interactions with the mouse and keyboard as
well as window resizing.</p>

<h4 id="shadercompilation">Shader compilation</h4>

<p>Unlike your C++ code, shaders are compiled <em>at runtime</em>. This has a nice
advantage that you can change your shaders without restarting the main program.
So long as the change is noticed and the shaders are recompiled, the rendering
will be immediately updated.</p>

<p>Compilation errors (usually syntax errors) will be output from the main program
and the window will turn black (background color). For example, if your
<em>fragment shader</em> contained:</p>

<pre><code>#version 410 core
in vec3 pos_fs_in;
out vec3 color;
void main()
{
  color = pos_fs_in.x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would see an error printed to the screen:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: failed to compile fragment shader
ERROR: 0:6: Incompatible types (vec3 and float) in assignment (and no available implicit conversion)

ERROR: One or more attached shaders not successfully compiled

ERROR: Failed to link shader program
</code></pre>

<p>If you change this file, the main program should immediately notice the change
before drawing the next frame. If successful there will be no error message and
the screen may now draw something interesting.</p>

<h4 id="dataonthegpu">Data on the GPU</h4>

<p>From the perspective of the shader pipeline, data on the GPU is separated into
different types. For example, when we send the mesh vertex positions to the GPU
we&#8217;re associating one 3D position <em>per vertex</em>. This data is considered an
&#8220;attribute&#8221; of each vertex. Each vertex invokes a single execution of the vertex
shader and its corresponding position is given as the <code>in vec3 pos_vs_in;</code>
variable. The output of the vertex shader will be &#8220;varying&#8221; depending on the
input and computation conducted. Your program is responsible for setting this
output value in <code>out vec3 pos_cs_in</code>. This variable is named ending with
<code>_cs_in</code> because it will in turn be used as input to the next shader in the
pipeline <em>tessellation control shader</em>.</p>

<p>Small amounts of data that is constant and independent of the particular
vertex/tessellation patch/fragment being processed is labeled as &#8220;uniform&#8221; data.
The prototypical example of this is the perspective projection matrix: <code>uniform
mat4 proj</code>. Uniform data is usually changed once per draw frame (e.g., <code>uniform
float time_since_start</code> is updated with the number of seconds since the start of
the program) or once per &#8220;object&#8221; (e.g., <code>uniform bool is_moon;</code> is set based on
whether we&#8217;re drawing the first or second object in our scene).</p>

<p>Large amounts of data that may be randomly accessed by shaders is stored in
&#8220;texture&#8221; memory (e.g., color texture images). This data must be accessed by
sampling specific pixel values based on a given 2D locations (e.g., the U.V.
mapping of a fragment).</p>

<h3 id="tessellationcontrolshader">Tessellation Control Shader</h3>

<p>The tessellation control shader determines how to subdivide each input &#8220;patch&#8221;
(i.e., triangle). Unlike the subdivision we saw with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_surface">subdivision
surfaces</a>, the subdivision is
determined independently for each triangle and <em>not</em> called recursively.
The exact pattern of the resulting triangulation is left largely to
implementation. As the shader programmer, you have control over:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of new edges each input each should split into
(<code>gl_TessLevelOuter[1] = 5</code> means the edge across from vertex <code>1</code> (i.e., the
edge between vertices <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>) should be split into 5 edges); and</li>
<li>the number of edges to place toward the center of the patch
(<code>gl_TessLevelInner[0] = 5</code> would be a good choice if
<code>gl_TessLevelOuter[...] = 5</code> and a regular tessellation was desired).</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the vertex or fragment shader, the tessellation control shader has access
to attribute information at <em>all</em> of the vertices of a triangle. The main
responsibility of this shader is setting the <code>gl_TessLevelOuter</code> and
<code>gl_TessLevelInner</code> variables.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If the amount of subdivision along each edge is determined
independently for each triangle, how can we make sure neighboring triangles
subdivide their shared edge the same amount?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> ✌️</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tessellationevaluationshader">Tessellation Evaluation Shader</h3>

<p>The tessellation <em>evaluation</em> shader takes the result of the tessellation that
the tessellation <em>control</em> shader has specified. This shader is called once for
every vertex output during tessellation (including original corners). It has
access to the attribute information of the original corners (e.g., in our code
<code>in vec3 pos_es_in[]</code>) and a special variable <code>gl_TessCoord</code> containing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system">barycentric
coordinates</a> of the
current vertex. Using this information, it is possible to interpolate
information stored at the original corners onto the current vertex: for example,
the 3D position. Like the vertex and tessellation control shader, this shader
can change the 3D position of a vertex. This is the <em>last opportunity</em> to do
that, since the fragment shader cannot.</p>

<h3 id="howcomeicantuseinclude">How come I can&#8217;t use <code>#include</code>?</h3>

<p>Our glsl shader programs are not compiled from files. Instead the
CPU-side program must read the file contents into memory as strings and provide
the raw strings to the shader compiler. Unfortunately, this means there is no
<code>#include</code> preprocessor directive and sharing code across different shaders is a
burden.</p>

<p>In this assignment, we will use a <code>.json</code> file to collect the different files
whose contents are <em><strong>concatenated</strong></em> to form the input string to be compiled
for each shader. For example, in <code>data/test-01.json</code> you&#8217;ll see:</p>

<pre><code>{
  &quot;vertex&quot;: [ &quot;../src/version410.glsl&quot;,&quot;../src/pass-through.vs&quot;],
  &quot;tess_control&quot;: [ &quot;../src/version410.glsl&quot;,&quot;../src/pass-through.tcs&quot;],
  &quot;tess_evaluation&quot;: [ &quot;../src/version410.glsl&quot;,&quot;../src/pass-through.tes&quot;],
  &quot;fragment&quot;: [ &quot;../src/version410.glsl&quot;,&quot;../src/pass-through.fs&quot;]
}
</code></pre>

<p>This indicates that the string for the vertex shader is the concatenation of two
(2) files <code>../src/version410.glsl</code> and then <code>&quot;../src/pass-through.vs&quot;</code>.
Similarly, for each of the other shaders.</p>

<h3 id="shaderdebugging">Shader debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging shader programs must be done visually. Since we only see the result of
<em>all</em> computation, we can use the shader pipeline&#8217;s ability to set screen colors
to debug <em>all</em> computation simultaneously. For example, when debugging the
fragment shader we can check all values at once by setting the pixel color to a
value we expect (or don&#8217;t expect) depending on the computation. A few useful
commands come in handy:</p>

<p><code>color = 0.5+0.5*n;</code> will set the color based on the normal.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/normal-debug.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p><code>color = vec3(0.5,0.5,0)+vec3(0.5,0.5,0)*view_pos_fs_in.xyz</code> will set the color based on the 2D position.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/position-debug.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p><code>color = (1+(view_pos_fs_in.z - -3)/5)*vec3(1,1,1);</code> will set the color based on
the distance to the camera in the z-direction.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/distance-debug.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p><code>color = vec3(float(is_moon),1,0);</code> will set the color to yellow or green based
on a boolean value (in this case <code>is_moon</code>).</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/bool-debug.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<h2 id="bumpandnormalmaps">Bump and normal maps</h2>

<p>A <strong>bump map</strong> is a mapping from a surface point to a displacement along the
normal direction. A <strong>normal map</strong> is a mapping from a surface point to a unit
normal vector. In a mathematical sense, a normal map is non-sense. A point on a
surface has a specific normal completely determined by its local geometry. The
normal is the direction that goes in the <em>most outward</em> direction from the
surface. That is, the normal is perpendicular to the surface. Since a surface
is two dimensional, the directions that <em>stay on</em> the surface are spanned by a
two dimensional <em>tangent plane</em>.</p>

<p>Normal mapping is useful in computer graphics because we can drape the
appearance of a complex surface on top a low resolution and simple one. To
create a consistent and believable looking normal map, we can first generate a
plausible bump map. Each point <span class="math">\(\mathbf{p}∈ \mathbb{R}³\)</span> on the surface is moved to a new
position <span class="math">\(\mathbf{\tilde{p}} ∈ \mathbb{R}³\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\mathbf{\tilde{p}}(\mathbf{p}) := \mathbf{p} + h(\mathbf{p}) \ \mathbf{\hat{n}}(\mathbf{p}) ,
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(h : \mathbb{R}³ → \mathbb{R}\)</span> is the bump height amount function (could
be negative) and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{\hat{n}}(\mathbf{p}) : \mathbb{R}³ → \mathbb{R}³\)</span> is the
<em>mathematically</em> correct normal at <span class="math">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>.</p>

<p>If our bump height <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is a smooth function over the surface, we can compute the
<em>perceived</em> normal vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{\tilde{n}}\)</span> by taking a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">finite
difference</a> of the 3D position:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\mathbf{\tilde{n}} = \frac{∂\ \mathbf{p}}{∂\ \mathbf{T}} ×
\frac{∂\ \mathbf{p}}{∂\ \mathbf{B}} ≈ 
\left(\frac{\mathbf{\tilde{p}(\mathbf{p} + ε \mathbf{T}})-\mathbf{\tilde{p}}(\mathbf{p})}{ε}\right) ×
\left(\frac{\mathbf{\tilde{p}(\mathbf{p} + ε \mathbf{B}})-\mathbf{\tilde{p}}(\mathbf{p})}{ε}\right)
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\mathbf{T},\mathbf{B}∈ \mathbb{R}³\)</span> are orthogonal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector">tangent and
bi-tangent vectors</a> in the tangent
plane at <span class="math">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(ε\)</span> is a small number (e.g., <code>0.0001</code>). By abuse of
notation, we&#8217;ll make sure that this approximate perceived normal is unit length
by dividing by its length:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\mathbf{\tilde{n}} ←
\frac{\mathbf{\tilde{n}}}{‖\mathbf{\tilde{n}}‖}.
\]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can we always recover <em>some</em> orthogonal tangent vectors <span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> from
the unit normal
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{n}\)</span> ?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> ☝️</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<p>There are no <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19709740/148668">header files</a>.
Accordingly, this assignment is organized a bit differently. The <code>src/</code>
directory contains glsl files whose contents should be completed or replaced.
Some of the functions have an element of creative freedom (e.g.,
<code>src/bump_position.glsl</code>), while others are have a well-defined specification
(e.g., <code>src/identity.glsl</code>).</p>

<p>Since glsl does not support <code>#include</code>, the comments may hint that a previously
defined function can/should/must be used by writing <code>// expects: ...</code>.</p>

<p>You may check the corresponding <code>.json</code> example file to see specifically which
glsl files are loaded (and in which order) for each test program.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, <em><strong>do not declare new functions</strong></em>. </p>
